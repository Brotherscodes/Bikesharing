# Bikesharing

<b/>

## Project Overview:

<b>

Using `Tableau` to create a presentation and analysis to pitch to investors that a bike-sharing program for Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, some of the key stakeholders have requested to see a bike trip analysis of New York City where the same program has been successful. We are going to answer three main questions as well as provide other informative visualizations of the data to answer these questions. The dataset consists of a total of 2,343,246 recorded bike-shares.

1. What is the length of time that bikes are checkout out for all riders and genders?
2. How many bike trips are recorded for all riders and genders for each hour of the weekday?
3. How many bike trips are recorded for each type of user and gender for each weekday?

This graph answers the first question our investors have asked. The visualization suggests that the average time bikes are checked out is between 6-7 minutes with Men as the user majority.

Bike Trips vary by the hour of day with the peak hours at 8am in the morning and between 5-6pm in the evening. The above two graphs answer our second question.

This data provides the information we need to answer our third question. Thursday is the most popular day for bike rentals with a total of 353,508 rentals recorded.

This graph shows us the top ten start stations. `Pershing Square North` is the most popular station for bike rentals followed by `E 17th St & Broadway`.
